# GRIP-Task1---Clustering-of-Iris-Flower-Dataset
Clustering using K-means algorithm for Iris flower dataset.
Objective: Find the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. 

About the Dataset: The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The iris data set is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes. The dataset is included in R base and Python in the machine learning library scikit-learn, so that users can access it without having to find a source for it.

Attribute Information:
Sepal length in cm
sepal width in cm
Petal length in cm
Petal width in cm
Class - Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa and Iris Virginica.

K-means algorithm is used for analysis of iris flower dataset. After carefully conducting the modeling it is observed that petal length, petal width and sepal length are three significant features which contribute in proper clustering. The optimum number of clusters are 3. The setosa class of iris flower is linearly seperable from other two classes; however the other two classes i.e. versicolor and virginica show overlap.
